To distinguish a DATA from a METHOD with or without SETGET follow this rules:

DATA: xyz is a DATA when the List of DATAs contains items xyz ('get' message) and _xyz ('set' message).

METHOD with SETGET: xyz is a METHOD with SETGET when the List of METHODs contains items xyz and _xyz.

INLINE or METHOD without SETGET: xyz is a METHOD without SETGET when the List of METHODs contains item xyz and not contains item _xyz.

NOTES:

When the List of DATAs contains item _xyz but not contains item xyz, in the parent class xyz is a DATA and in the class is a METHOD without SETGET.

For a sample, see "Determine the DATAs, METHODs and INLINEs of a given class.prg"
