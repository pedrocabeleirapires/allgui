To rebuild ooHG libraries, follow this procedure:

1. Open a Windows Console at C:\OOHG\SOURCE folder.

2. Execute command
      "MAKELIB.BAT HB30" to rebuild using Harbour 3.0 and MinGW compiler.
      "MAKELIB.BAT HB32" to rebuild using Harbour 3.2 and MinGW compiler.
      "MAKELIB.BAT XB"   to rebuild using xHarbour    and BCC   compiler.

   You can also use MAKELIB30.BAT or MAKELIB32.BAT or MAKELIBXB.BAT instead.
   To use another C compilers you must tweak and use one of these alternatives: MAKELIB_BCC.BAT, MAKELIB_PC.BAT or MAKELIB_VC.BAT

   If the rebuild fails check that the system PATH includes C:\OOHG and that the following environment variables are not set:
      HG_HRB
      HG_MINGW
      HG_ROOT
      LIB_GUI
      LIB_HRB

   If you have any doubt, please create a file named CLEAN.BAT with the following content:
      SET PATH=C:\OOHG
      SET HG_HRB=
      SET HG_MINGW=
      SET HG_ROOT=
      SET LIB_GUI=
      SET LIB_HRB=
      CALL MAKELIB.BAT HB32
   and execute it.

The libraries can, also, be rebuild using the Harbour's 'hbmk2' tool.
See How to build the ooHG libraries for Harbour 3.x and MinGW using Harbour's 'hbmk2' utility.
