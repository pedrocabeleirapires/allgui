To install the ooHG official distro, follow this procedure:

1. Download the .ZIP file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/oohg/files/.
2. If you already have a C:\OOHG folder in your hard drive, it's strongly recommended that you delete, rename or move it to another folder to avoid problems and improve support.
3. Extract the content of the downloaded file to C:\ folder so its files are placed at C:\OOHG folder.
4. Add C:\OOHG to your system's PATH so you can build samples and applications using COMPILE.BAT batch command file.
5. If you want to update the distro with the CVS changes, see How to update ooHG distro with the CVS changes.
