To download, for the first time, the ooHG sources from the CVS in SourceForge, follow this procedure:

1. Install TortoiseCVS from http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml
2. Open Windows Explorer, select C:\ and create a folder named OOHGCVS.
3. Right click the new folder and select "CVS Checkout".
   A new window will open.
4. Click on the CVSROOT field and write:
   :pserver:anonymous@oohg.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/oohg
5. Click on the Module field and write:
   oohg
6. Click on the OK button, wait for the download to finish and close the window.
7. The folder C:\OOHGCVS now contains a new folder called OOHG, which holds a local copy of all the files in the CVS repository.
   This folder is associated with the CVS in SourceForge in such a way that TortoiseCVS can keep track of changes.
8. Move the OOHG folder to C:\ and, when Windows Explorer asks if you want to overwrite existing files, answer Yes.
9. When the operation is finished, delete the no longer needed C:\OOHGCVS folder.
10. Rebuild the libraries (see How to rebuild ooHG libraries).

The next time you want to update your local copy with the latest version of the files in the CVS, follow this procedure:

1. Open Windows Explorer and locate the C:\OOHG folder.
2. Right click on it and select "CVS Update". A new window will open.
3. Wait for the update to finish.
4. The window will display the details of the processed files and the actions taken.
5. To rebuild the libraries, see How to rebuild ooHG libraries .
