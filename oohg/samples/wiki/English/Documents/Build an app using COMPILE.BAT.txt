In this article I will assume that you are using the ooHG official distro installed in C:\OOHG folder, with Harbour and MinGW as compilers (default options).
First of all, be sure you're system's PATH includes C:\OOHG, if not please add the folder.

To build an app, follow this procedure:

1. Open a DOS box and change to the folder containing the source code (.prg files).
2. Enter the following command: compile myApp
3. To generate a preprocessor output (.ppo file) use: compile myApp /p
4. If the app will use console mode use: compile myApp /c
5. If you want to add the debugger use: compile myApp /d

Notes

1. If the app has more than one .prg file (e.g: myApp.prg and myFuncs.prg) to successfully build it you must add at the end of myApp.prg:
#include "myFuncs.prg"
2. To include a resource files (.rc file) you must name it myApp.rc and place it in the same folder were myApp.prg sits.
   To use additional .rc files add them to end of myApp.rc using #include "another.rc".
3. By default, the building process also includes the ooHG resource file (see oohg.rc file in include folder).
