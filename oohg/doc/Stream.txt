TStream class
=============

TStream class is designed to simplify data stream management. It
allows to receive (and send) raw data from "any" source, stores
it on it's own buffer, and provide it on the required way. For
example, you can store it until an EOL character is received, or
it reaches an specific lenght.

Approaching classes' flexibility, it's possible to use same code
for process data from different sources with the same code (you
can get data from a file, network socket, serial port, or memory
data).

It can be used for data conversion. TStreamUnZip receives
compressed data FROM ANY TSTREAM CLASS, and returns uncompressed
data.

Some sample classes are:

TStreamBase:   TStream's base class. It "reads" data from memory
               (data is already in memory).
TStreamFile:   Reads data from a file.
TStreamSocket: Reads/writes data from a network socket.
TStreamSerial: Reads/writes data from a serial port.
TStreamUnZip:  Reads compressed data and returns it uncompressed.
