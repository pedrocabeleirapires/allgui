                      HWGUI - Harbour Win32 GUI library

   Installation procedure is very simple.

   There are few bat files to build HwGUI with C compiler of your choice:

   make_b32.bat  - Borland C
   make_pc.bat   - Pelles C
   make_vc.bat   - Microsoft Visual C
   make_w32.bat  - Open Watcom C
   makemngw.bat  - Mingw

   You need to set the environment variable HB_PATH, which must contain a path
   to your Harbour directory. This can be done in your Windows environment or
   by adding a line to appropriate bat file:

      SET HB_PATH=c:\harbour

   Then run the selected bat file and you'll get hwgui.lib, procmisc.lib,
   hbxml.lib  and qhtm.lib in lib/ directory.

       To build samples you need to run appropriate .bat files, fixing environment
   variables there.
       For Dbc you should have rddads.lib and ace32.lib ( by default - in 
   harbour/lib/ directory.
       Bld.bat should be executed with prg file name as a parameter:
   bld a
